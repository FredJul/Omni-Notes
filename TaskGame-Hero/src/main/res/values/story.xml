        <item>school_friend@R:So, finally you\'ll get graduated tomorrow!\n
            school_friend@R:Are you stressed by the final examination?\n
            hero@L:Well, not really.\n
            hero@L:I don\'t expect the examination to be that hard. This invoker school is not famous for its difficulty.\n
            school_friend@R:Sure, that\'s why I selected that one!\n
            school_friend@R:But still, what about a small training fight?\n
            hero@L:I don\'t really need to, you know?\n
            school_friend@R:Oh, come on! I\'ll start gently with a small card.\n
            school_friend@R:And I\'m really curious to see what kind of creatures you can invoke now.\n
            hero@L:If you insist…</item>
        <item>school_friend@R:Well, I knew you would have defeated that one easily.\n
            hero@L:Is that all you can do?\n
            school_friend@R:Don\'t worry, the next one will be stronger!\n
            school_friend@R:If I were you I would get some new cards at the school library.\n
            school_friend@R:I heard that the owner was once a great invoker but now he is starting to get too old for that and
            trade his invoker cards in exchange of some well-executed tasks.\n
            school_friend@R:That\'s a easy way to become a better invoker, but be careful: you can\'t take too many card in your
            deck unless you become more experienced and gain more free slots.</item>

        <item>school_friend</item>
        <item>school_friend@R:So, ready to fight?\n
            hero@L:I don\'t need to be ready to defeat you.</item>
        <item>school_friend@R:Again, it seems to be so easy for you that it\'s almost frustrating…\n
            school_friend@R:But it\'s not finished yet, I still have something to try.\n
            school_friend@R:I have some support card to use after my creatures to reinforce them, so you would better prepare
            yourself.</item>

        <item>school_friend</item>
        <item>school_friend@R:Now I\'ll go full power! Prepare yourself!\n
            hero@L:How long will that last? I\'m not in the mood of playing.</item>
        <item>school_friend@R:Well, I admit there is no use to continue, I guess you\'re ready for the examination.\n
            school_friend@R:More you level up and more you\'ll be able to easily invoke several powerful creatures, I have to
            admit I\'m curious to see how far you\'ll end up in the army.\n
            school_friend@R:By the way, do you already knows what you want to do after your diploma?\n
            hero@L:Yes. However it is a bit complicated to explain.\n
            school_friend@R:Huh? OK, anyway the Erya Kingdom is recruiting almost everyone for his army, so I guess you won\'t have much
            choice actually.</item>

        <item>school_master</item>
        <item>school_master@R:Here is the final examination day!\n
            school_master@R:How do you feel?\n
            hero@L:As usual, ready.\n
            school_master@R:Great. You just have to win that battle and you\'ll be an official Erya Kingdom invoker!</item>
        <item>school_master@R:Here you are! That wasn\'t hard for you, right?\n
            school_master@R:I\'m happy to say you\'re now an official invoker, you\'ll soon receive your diploma.\n
            school_master@R:Afterward you\'ll be interviewed by an Erya Kingdom officer. The kingdom is trying to reinforce his army and
            they integrate a lot of students.</item>

        <item>officer</item>
        <item>officer@R:So before we start let me present myself: I was also an invoker student and I\'m now lieutenant in the Erya army.\n
            officer@R:I\'m notably in charge of recruiting invokers from all over the kingdom and assign them to a specific regiment.\n
            officer@R:First of all, show me what you are capable of.</item>
        <item />

        <item>officer</item>
        <item>officer@R:I have to say I\'m impressed. You have your place in our great army.\n
            hero@L:I don\'t want to integrate the army.\n
            officer@R:Well, I\'m afraid you cannot really refuse the proposition. The King orders are clears, we need to requisitioned all
            capable people.\n
            officer@R:If you refuse you risk to be judge for disloyalty.\n
            hero@L:Fine. But before bring me to the King\'s counselor. Even if I don\'t integrate the army, I can be very useful to the King.\n
            hero@L:I have some information that will interest the King, and I can do more than what you have seen for now.\n
            hero@L:Let me prove it to you right now with a second fight, but this time do not restrain yourself.</item>
        <item>officer@R:I see… You\'re clearly above the level of a classic newly graduated invoker.\n
            hero@L:Now please bring me to the counselor. I have a proposal that he will like.\n
            officer@R:OK, let\'s go to the King\'s Castle. But don\'t be too optimistic, I\'ll closely watch you and there is big chances he will
            not accept to receive you.</item>

        <item>counselor</item>
        <item>officer@R:You\'re lucky, the counselor accepted to see you, but he wants to know your motivations.\n
            counselor@R:Exactly. Be strong is not a good enough reason to see the King, what do you want exactly?\n
            hero@L:I came from the forest village of Oras.\n
            hero@L:The life was peaceful there, however the river is almost dried now. So the forest is dying and the village with it.\n
            officer@R:Could it be…\n
            hero@L:Yes. It is due to the fact that the King had rerouted the river for the army needs.\n
            counselor@R:So you are here for revenge? The whole continent is in need of water and we unfortunately have to do some choices.\n
            hero@L:I know the situation. I also know that the recent tensions between us, the Myrth Kingdom and the Qahor Kingdom are due to the water.\n
            hero@L:But I have a solution and a deal.\n
            counselor@R:And what would that be?\n
            hero@L:I cannot speak here with so many people around. I request an interview with the King.\n
            counselor@R:Our majesty is well occupied, as you can imagined. I\'m sorry but this is out of question.\n
            counselor@R:Guards, please escort this young women outside.\n
            hero@L:Wait!</item>
        <item>counselor@R:Why are you opposing resistance? I could execute you for that, and what tells me that you do not want to harm our Majesty?\n
            hero@L:It is really important for me to see the King, and killing him will not save my village.\n
            counselor@R:Well… You\'ll first explain your plan to me in privacy. Then I may change my mind.</item>
