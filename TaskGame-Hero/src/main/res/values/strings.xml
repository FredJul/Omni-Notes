        <item>school_friend@R:So, finally you\'ll get graduated tomorrow!\n
            school_friend@R:Are you stressed by the final examination?\n
            hero@L:Well, not really.\n
            hero@L:I don\'t expect the examination to be that hard. This invoker school is not famous for his difficulties.\n
            school_friend@R:Sure, that\'s why I selected that one!\n
            school_friend@R:But still, what about a small training fight?\n
            hero@L:I don\'t really need to, you know?\n
            school_friend@R:Oh come on! I\'ll start gently with a small invocation creature.\n
            school_friend@R:And I\'m really curious to see what kind of creatures you have obtained now.\n

            school_friend@R:Don\'t worry, the next one will be stronger!\n
            school_friend@R:If I were you I would get some new cards at the school library.\n
            school_friend@R:I heard that the owner is getting too old to fight and trade his cards in exchange of some well-executed tasks.\n
            school_friend@R:Then looks at needed mana slots of cards in the top-right corner and compose the best deck you can!
